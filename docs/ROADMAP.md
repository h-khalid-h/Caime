# Roadmap and status

The live status of the build. Update this file at the end of every work block: tick what is
done **and verified**, add what was discovered, and keep "Blocked" honest. A box is ticked only
when the thing works end to end and has a test; partial work stays unticked with a note.

Legend: `[x]` done and verified · `[~]` in progress or partial (note says what is missing) ·
`[ ]` not started · `⛔` blocked on something outside the repository.

## M0 — Foundation

- [x] Monorepo (pnpm, hoisted), TypeScript, Biome, shared configs
- [x] Docs: PRD, product review, brand, competitive strategy, architecture, roadmap, goal
- [x] CLAUDE.md operating manual
- [x] GitHub repository [`h-khalid-h/Caishy`](https://github.com/h-khalid-h/Caishy), `main`
- [x] One API contract (`packages/core/src/api.ts`); server views annotated against it

## M1 — Core domain (`packages/core`)

- [x] Sphere and role taxonomy (inclusive, R28), complementary roles (PRD §53)
- [x] Zod schemas for every API payload
- [x] Attention engine (PRD §19–20, R7–R8)
- [x] Relationship policy engine: notifications, attention, privacy, workweek (R9–R11, R31)
- [x] Message intelligence: questions, requests, commitments, decisions, dates, amounts, links
      (PRD §23, R12) — English and Egyptian/MSA Arabic
- [x] Search query parser (PRD §25)
- [x] Privacy evaluator (PRD §34, §62)
- [x] Connect Kits registry (PRD §41, R19)
- [x] Formatting and ids

## M2 — Server foundation

- [x] Config, logging, errors, health, migrations under advisory lock
- [x] Auth: sign-up, sign-in, sessions (cookie + bearer), CSRF header, recovery codes, age gate
- [x] Profiles and identities, people search with privacy and age rules
- [x] Connections, requests with context, relationships (versioned, private, shared), history
- [x] Suggestions (relationship signals), custom roles, policies

## M3 — Messaging

- [x] Direct, group, topic conversations; participants; drafts
- [x] Messages: ordered, idempotent; replies, reactions, edit, delete; read state; polls; forward
- [x] Realtime hub (WebSocket + pg NOTIFY), typing, presence
- [x] Attention inbox API
- [x] Message requests from non-connections (R14)

## M4 — Memory, action, notification

- [x] Tasks, waiting, requests, reminders (R13); decisions; contexts
- [x] Suggestions from message intelligence (and emerging topics, follow-ups)
- [x] Conversation memory and asset index
- [x] Search across people, relationships, orgs, messages, assets, actions, contexts
- [~] Notifications: levels, burst consolidation, schedules, Web Push (VAPID) done; Expo push
      implemented but ⛔ needs EAS credentials for production builds; not yet exercised end to end
- [x] Jobs: reminders, held notifications, follow-ups, retention

## M5 — App (iOS, Android, Web)

- [x] Design system from `BRAND.md`: theme, primitives, wordmark, characters; light and dark
      verified in screenshots; the Minimal style swaps characters for icons wherever a guide
      appears (E2E, reviewed on screen)
- [x] Auth and onboarding: sign-up with live handle checks, sign-in, recovery codes, relationship
      defaults, find people (E2E)
- [x] Attention inbox, conversation, composer, inline suggestions, typing, presence, reciprocal
      read ticks (E2E, phone and desktop)
- [x] Connect flow in ≤ 3 taps (sphere, role, done), accept with a label, People (E2E)
- [x] Share links: `/@handle` opens that person or organization, found only as search would
      find them; a Caishy link in a message opens in the app; a desktop browser without a
      share sheet copies the link. Someone signed out keeps the link through sign-in, sign-up
      and onboarding ("You came here for @noor") and lands on it (`handles.test.ts`,
      `paths.test.ts`, E2E)
- [x] Person profile, relationship change and its history, one line per change (E2E)
- [x] Search: finds a message and opens its conversation scrolled to it, marked (E2E)
- [x] Settings: every page opens; the theme follows the account to a fresh device (E2E);
      download your data and delete your account (E2E)
- [x] Actions: add one in words ("by Friday" becomes its due date), finish it, undo; a request
      from someone lands in Asked me (E2E)
- [x] Alerts: requests and message bursts arrive, each with why it was held or sent (E2E)
- [x] Spaces tab (phones) and rail item (desktop): your spaces busiest first, start one, open
      one (E2E, screenshots)
- [x] Desktop web: rail, list, detail and context panel (E2E screenshots); keyboard shortcuts:
      Ctrl/⌘ K search, Alt ↑/↓ between conversations, ↑ edits your last message, ? lists them
      (E2E)
- [x] Realtime client with reconnect and catch-up; on-device cache with revalidation; offline
      outbox: a message written offline sends the moment the network returns (E2E)
- [x] Stickers (Caishy Friends, 16): sent, and arrive live (E2E)
- [~] Native: iOS and Android bundles export (Hermes); not yet run on a device or simulator.
      Share links open the app only once it claims its domain (iOS associated domains, Android
      app links, and the two files the server would serve under `/.well-known/`)

## M6 — Expansion

- [~] Files, images (metadata stripped, thumbnails), resumable uploads, ranges done; voice notes
      store and play; transcription ⛔ needs a speech-to-text provider
- [x] Organizations: a business, shop, clinic, school, nonprofit or public service with a
      profile anyone can find and a team. Its handle shares one namespace with people's, so
      nobody can pose as it. It verifies its domain with one DNS TXT record
      (`_caishy-verify.<domain>`); only then is it "Verified · <domain>" and its team "Verified at
      <name>", and no other organization can claim that domain. Changing the domain unverifies it
      until the new one is proven. The team is made of adult connections; owners and admins
      manage it and the domain; an owner who leaves or deletes their account hands it on; the
      last one out closes it (`orgs.test.ts`, E2E)
- [x] Business inbox: a customer messages an organization from its page (found in Connect or
      by its link) and gets one conversation with it; the whole team is in it and answers as the
      organization, so the customer never sees who (masked in every view, search, notification,
      live event and AI transcript). The inbox sorts its conversations by what they need
      (customer waiting, new, assigned to me, waiting on customer, escalated, resolved), longest
      wait first; whoever answers an unassigned conversation has it; anyone on the team can hand
      it on; escalating tells the owner and admins; resolving holds until the customer writes.
      States come from the order of messages, never timestamps. It's on the desktop rail and at
      the top of Chats for anyone on a team, and team members' own chats never fill with it
      (`business.test.ts`, E2E). [ ] Blocking an organization; organizations starting
      conversations; customers under 18; AI follow-ups and requests across it
- [x] Spaces: a family, team, project, community or school with its people and conversations.
      Everyone is in its General conversation (which goes by the space's name); its other
      conversations are open to join; a topic that keeps coming up in General becomes one.
      People join only through someone inside who is connected with them; owners and admins
      manage it; an owner who leaves or deletes their account hands it on; the last one out
      closes it. Its kind picks the cards its conversations offer (`spaces.test.ts`, E2E)
- [x] Connect Kits as cards: approval, meeting, review, order, delivery, invoice, purchase
      order, payment request, support ticket, appointment, and polls; offered only where they fit
      the relationship, moved by the right person, live (`kits.test.ts`, E2E). [ ] Location,
      shared album and checklist kits
- [x] AI assist with Claude, off until each adult turns it on (Privacy settings), never on
      private conversations: rewrite a draft (clearer, shorter, more formal, friendlier, in the
      relationship's tone), translate a message, catch me up (offered when ten or more are
      unread), find follow-ups (filed as ordinary suggestions, never twice). Everything it writes
      is labelled "Suggested by Caishy" and used only on a tap; the heuristics stay the default
      and the fallback (`ai.test.ts` against a Messages API stub, E2E)
- [x] Export and account deletion (`account.test.ts`, E2E); others keep their conversations,
      shared files and the actions they were waiting on
- [x] Retention: disappearing messages per conversation (24 hours to 1 year), set from the
      conversation's details, announced to everyone in it (`system-messages.test.ts`, E2E)
- [x] Block, report, rate limits, link safety
- [ ] API tokens, webhooks, bots and agents
- [ ] Metrics and plan entitlements
- [ ] Calls (WebRTC 1:1 on web) ⛔ TURN relay needed for reliable production calls

## M7 — Ship

- [x] One image (API, realtime, web): built, pushed to `ghcr.io/h-khalid-h/caishy` and
      smoke-tested by CI on every push to `main` (readiness, the page, security headers)
- [x] CI: lint, typecheck, tests on Postgres 16, build, web budget (427.6 KB gzip against 450 KB),
      Playwright E2E against the production bundle
- [x] Security review: `docs/SECURITY.md` lists each control with the test proving it, and the
      gaps. [ ] Third-party penetration test
- [ ] EAS config and store builds ⛔ Apple and Google developer accounts, `EXPO_ACCESS_TOKEN`
- [ ] Deploy to EasyPanel ⛔ needs the app created there from the image (`docs/DEPLOY.md`) and the
      `EASYPANEL_DEPLOY_WEBHOOK` repository secret, or `EASYPANEL_URL` and
      `EASYPANEL_API_TOKEN` in the environment settings

## Log

- 2026-09-26 — Session 1: docs written; brand system adopted from the owner's board (vector
  recreation pending); monorepo scaffolding started.
- 2026-09-26 — Session 1 (cont.): core engines (105 tests), brand tokens (49 tests), server M2–M4
  and files (71 integration tests on real Postgres). GitHub repository still unreachable, so all
  commits are local to the container. Next: the Expo app (M5).
- 2026-09-26 — Session 2: pushed to GitHub. Shared API contract. The universal app (auth,
  onboarding, attention inbox, conversations, people, connect, actions, search, settings, desktop
  three-column layout, realtime, outbox, stickers). Driving it end to end found and fixed: live
  read receipts bypassing the reciprocal rule, a device locale ("en-US@posix") that broke every
  date, a restored cache that hid new conversations, a vague commitment titled "It" plus a
  duplicate suggestion. Server bundle, Dockerfile, CI, E2E suite and deploy guide. Tests: 111
  core, 49 brand, 74 server, 2 E2E.
- 2026-09-26 — Session 2 (cont.): the image builds, pushes and passes its smoke test in CI.
  Account export and deletion (a deleted account no longer takes other people's waiting actions
  with it: migration 0003). Relationship history on profiles, one event per change. Search opens
  the message it found. A second E2E spec (history, search, stickers, offline, settings) found
  and fixed: raw highlight markers in search results, a change recorded as an addition plus a
  change, and the app staying "offline" after a network blip on Chromium (NetInfo's web build
  never hears the network return). Alerts read "sent 56 messages (56)" and
  "outside 08:00–20:00" on a Saturday; they now read "sent 56 messages" and "outside Mon–Fri
  08:00–20:00". Keyboard shortcuts; their test found that editing your last message left the
  old text in the inbox preview. Connect Kits as live cards; the server now owns what a card
  says and where it stands (it used to store whatever a client sent, "approved" included). Its
  test's frames showed 55 "Update N" messages each suggesting a task titled with the number: a
  verb and only a number is no longer a request. Disappearing messages; building them found
  that system lines (group created, people added or leaving) were stored without words and
  showed as blank pills, that any conversation change touching only shared settings (renaming a
  group) failed with a 500, and that phones had no way into a group's details. Reviewing the
  Minimal style found characters it didn't replace (Connect, Search, About, the error screen).
  Arabic messages now align right on every platform (they relied on the browser's own
  direction, which iOS doesn't do). A flaky E2E run traced to a real race: a message arriving
  while a conversation's first page loaded was dropped; the app now applies live changes again
  once the page lands (unit-tested; the app has unit tests now). Tests: 125 core, 49 brand,
  86 server, 3 app, 14 E2E.
- 2026-09-26 — Session 2 (cont.): AI assist through Claude (rewrite, translate, catch me up,
  find follow-ups), with server-side refusal fallbacks, tested against a local stand-in for the
  Messages API in both the server tests and E2E. Building it found four older bugs. Waiting
  items were titled by their object alone, so "I'll confirm the caterer" became "Caterer"; only
  hand-over verbs (send, share) are titled that way now. After a reload, a conversation took its
  unread line from the device's stale copy, so neither "New messages" nor the catch-up offer
  appeared; it now waits for a fresh copy. On desktop web, the Reply and React buttons beside a
  message vanished the moment the pointer reached them (a pressable inside another ends the
  outer one's hover), so they could never be clicked; they sit beside the bubble now. And a
  message sent after a conversation's first page loaded but before the socket was listening was
  never shown; the app now catches up on every connection, the first included (E2E holds the
  socket back to prove it). Each AI call is recorded without its text (feature, model, tokens,
  time, outcome) and is in the person's export. Tests: 126 core, 49 brand, 94 server, 3 app,
  16 E2E.
- 2026-09-26 — Session 2 (cont.): Spaces, with the Spaces tab. Building them found two more
  bugs. A system line in a conversation preview read "You: Noor Haddad started…" instead of
  "You started…". And the flaky right-to-left test was real: after a reload, a live message
  written into the restored cache made TanStack treat that cache as fresh, so the conversation
  never refetched and a message sent just before the reload stayed missing. Live writes now
  keep the data's fetch time and its refetch mark (unit-tested; fails without the fix). A
  sheet that emptied itself while closing now keeps its content until it's gone. Tests: 129
  core, 49 brand, 101 server, 4 app, 17 E2E.
- 2026-09-26 — Session 2 (cont.): Organizations, with DNS verification and the trust label their
  teams carry. Building them found two bugs in how the server serves the web app. Any page whose
  path ended in something like a file extension got the API's 404 instead of the app, so an
  organization with a dot in its handle (`/o/nile.dental`) broke on reload, and so did a link
  whose query ended in one (`?h=sara.ali`); a page load is now recognized by what the browser
  asks for, and a missing file is still a 404, never the app (`web.test.ts`, fails without the
  fix). And the Connect screen's "Find me there" link pointed at a domain and a route that don't
  exist; that's next. Tests: 133 core, 49 brand, 110 server, 4 app, 18 E2E.
- 2026-09-26 — Session 2 (cont.): share links. `/@handle` opens a person or an organization,
  and a link survives signing up: the welcome page says whose link it is, onboarding ends on it,
  and Back goes home. Sharing on a desktop browser used to do nothing (there's no share sheet);
  it copies the link now. Tests: 133 core, 49 brand, 112 server, 8 app, 19 E2E.
- 2026-09-26 — Session 2 (cont.): the Business inbox. The hard part was R15's "staff reply as
  the organization": a customer's view of a conversation passes through one mask (every id but
  theirs reads as the organization's), applied where messages are built and on the realtime
  bus, and tested against every place the team could leak (views, live events, typing, reads,
  search, memory, shared links, cards, notifications); each protection fails its test when
  removed. Two bugs found on the way: whose turn it was compared timestamps, which tie within a
  millisecond, so it reads the order of messages now; and embedding the conversation screen in
  the inbox route moved it into the shared startup chunk (460 KB against 450), so on desktop
  the inbox is a list pane beside the conversation's own route, as Chats is. Tests: 135 core,
  49 brand, 121 server, 8 app, 20 E2E.
